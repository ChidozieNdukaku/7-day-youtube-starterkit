# 7-day-cloud-youtube-starterkit

So you want to start your own cloud/dev YouTube channel? I've collected all my learnings and experience from [building my own](youtube.com/madebygps) into this repo. My goal is to get you from zero to first video published in 7 days, and then for you to have everything you need to keep the momentum going. I believe in you, and I hope you do to.

Also, I'll update this whenever I have more info to share :)

## How do I use this repo?

I've setup the format so you can start any day, and take it day by day, until you publish your first video, committing about 2 hours a day, and 1 rest day before you repeat the process, which is day 7.

| Day | Task            | Time commitment        |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------|
| [1](day1/README.md)   | Research topic  | 2 hours                |
| [2](day2/README.md)   | Write script    | 2 hours                |
| [3](day3/README.md)   | Practice script | 2 hours                |
| [4](day4/README.md)   | Record          | 1 hour                 |
| [5](day5/README.md)   | Edit            | 1 hour                 |
| [6](day6/README.md)   | Publish         | 30 min                 |
| [7](day7/README.md)   | Rest            | as much as you need :) |
