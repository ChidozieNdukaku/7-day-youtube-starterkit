# Day 5: Edit the video

In the [start here guide](../start-here/README.md) I suggested gear and software, and tutorials on them. Brush up on those and make sure everything is set up before you get started with this day.

Also here's a video I made on how I [make videos](https://youtu.be/2nPXhwPpy04) might be helpful here. 

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 2 hours for this.

- **Tools you'll need:** Editing software.

## Goal of this Day

Edit your video and have the final file ready to upload to YouTube.


## Steps

### 1. Import all your footage into your editor

Grab all your clips and import them into your project in your video editor. Depending on which software you are using, it'll differ. I added some tutorials in the [Start Here](../start-here/README.md) guide.

> **Action step:** Import footage to your editor.

### 2. Edit intro

Here is where your own style comes in. Do you want to add a logo/branding in your intro? Do you want music in the background? Up to you. The only thing you HAVE to do here is make sure there aren't any long pauses or clips in there you don't want (for example usually the first few and last seconds of a clip are you hitting the record button, cut those out.)

### 2. Edit demo

Similar to your intro, you can chose to have background music. Just make sure to clip out any long pauses and parts you don't want in there. If you did make a mistake in the recording, cut it out. As you clip things out, make sure you're watching how the footage changes so it's still coherent and you're not missing important parts.

### 3. Edit outro

More of the same advise here :)

### 4. Edit audio

Now listen to the audio of each section and make sure it's loud enough. Usually I open another YouTube video and play it while my video is playing and compare the two. Is mine too quiet? Is mine too loud? I'll adjust accordingly.

> **Action step:** Edit your audio

### 4. Export video

Now that you've cut everything out, added any branding, and adjusted audio. It's time to export your video. Make sure it's in the right format for YouTube. This will depend on which editor you are using, look up a tutorial on that. Here's one for [Adobe Premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9T_aPmNepA)

### 4. That's it

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
