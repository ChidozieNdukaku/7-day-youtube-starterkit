# Day 4: Record

In the [start here guide](../start-here/README.md) I suggested gear and software, and tutorials on them. Brush up on those and make sure everything is set up before you get started with this day.

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 2 hours for this.

- **Tools you'll need:** Camera, microphone, screen recording software.

## Goal of this Day

Recording the intro, demo, and conclusion of your video.

## Steps

### 1. Record the demo

Since the demo is the longest part, I like to start with it. The secret here is to keep your script open on some area that is outside of the recording area (on a different screen if you have one.) At this point, you've practiced this part a few times. Go ahead and hit record and go through the demo.

As you get better at this, you'll need to reference a script less, and eventually you might not even need and/or want a script.

You can chose to record your face or not in your demos. If you do, make sure your face is taking up too much real estate or covering important parts of your screen. Also make sure your font size is legible.

Another trick here, if you mess up, you don't have to stop and record again. Keep the recording going and take a pause, just so there's some silence to indicate where you need to cut something out when you're editing (more on that in the next day). After a few seconds of silence, go again.

Nothing frustrates me more than having to record multiple takes and it's stopped me from working on a video. So don't skip the practice :)

> **Action step:** Use you screen recording software to record your demo.

### 2. Record the intro and conclusion

Time to record your intro and conclusion. The only thing I can say you 100% need here is for your face to be in the video. You can stand, sit, whatever you want here.

For example, in [this video](https://youtu.be/p0zgKoxpu24) I am sitting down, and in [this one](https://youtu.be/AFF4kuBTtNg) I am (too close) standing.

[Here I'm holding the camera](https://youtu.be/dMkuv7rYGYY) and sort of walking and talking and in [this video](https://youtu.be/kqswzAAC1Ek) I'm sitting behind a desk. The point is you have options and I encourage you to find what works and feels right.

> **Action step:** Use you camera (tripod) and microphone to record your intro and conclusion.

### 3. Organize your files

Now you should have 3 files, intro, demo and conclusion. I save all my footage in a folder called RAW inside of a folder with the name of the video. It's up to you where and how you name things. Just keep them together because it's easier to import into your video editor this way.

### 4. That's it

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
