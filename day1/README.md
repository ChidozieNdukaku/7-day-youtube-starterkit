# Day 1 guide: Research the topic

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 2 hours for this. For best results, pick a topic you are familiar with, it's the simplest way to get started, because you'll have to research less and you'll be more confident with your delivery.

- **Tools you'll need:** Somewhere to take notes

    It's a good idea to have one area where you have all the research for your videos. Perhaps that's a github repo, or maybe you use something like OneNote, EverNote, Notion, Apple Notes, maybe even good old pen and paper. I personally have a private GitHub repo called video-notes but you can use whatever you'd like.

## Steps

### 1. Pick your topic

I find that this is where most people get stuck. "What am I even going to talk about?" The good news is you don't have to come up with some unique brand new idea because nothing is new on the internet. It's more important to focus on how you are delivering versus what you are! Try to keep the topic specific, because you'll use it for your video title and thumbnail later on, and it'll help keep the scope and length of the video shorter.

- Instead of trying to cover an entire introduction to javascript, how about focusing an introduction to functions in javascript?
- Instead of trying Azure Functions, how about a specific binding?

You get my point, don't kill your momentum right from the start by picking a topic that takes more time.

If you're still having trouble finding something to talk about. My very first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zgKoxpu24) was on a task I had accomplished that very same day at work.

- Is there a task you accomplished today?
- Is there something you learned recently?
- Is there an experience you'd like to share? (I really like doing these, most of my latest videos have been on this type.)
- Did you recently pass a certification and want to share your tips?
  
### 2. Write down bullet points and resources
