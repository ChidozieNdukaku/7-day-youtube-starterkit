# Day 7: Rest and recharge

Congrats, you've uploaded your first YouTube video :) I know it seems like a lot of work, but I promise it gets easier as you become more comfortable with the tools and being on camera. 

If you made a video following this guide, please share it with me on Twitter, I'd love to watch and share with others, and even showcase some of them on my own channel!

Good luck to you.
